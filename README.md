# Turnip React

A react version for our website.

## Why?

I realized that my React skills are getting rusty. This might seem so inefficient but I'm making a subdomain react.turnipxenon.com using React solely for refreshing myself with how to use React. I also don't have any public repository with more refined React examples, so here it is.

To be honest, the reason why I'm starting this is that I had a coding interview where I had to code in React. I was so rusty in React that it took me almost two hours making a calculator app that was so unsatisfactory with what I could have had. Next time, I want to be prepared. I'll try swapping between Svelte and React, because I personally love Svelte, and I don't wanna quit using it to focus on React solely for skill purposes.

Is this a blatant resume padder? Yep! <3 But hey, I gotta I know all of these, and I'm not bluffing.
